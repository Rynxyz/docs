## Step 1: Create an Account

First of all you need to create an account which will be used to access the service and where you will be able to check and pay your invoices.

For this you should head to https://billing.fluxhosting.xyz/login. If you dont have created an account yet, click this [link](https://billing.fluxhosting.xyz/register) to create a new account.

## Step 2: Get a Service

Once you have created a service you will need to navigate to the [homepage](https://billing.fluxhosting.xyz/) of our billing site. There you will be able to select the product category which you want to acquire.
